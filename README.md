# Heart Attack Prediction App

This is a machine learning-powered web application for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on user-provided medical data. The app uses a pre-trained **Decision Tree Classifier** model to predict whether a user is likely to have heart disease based on features like age, gender, blood pressure, glucose levels, and more.

## Demo

You can interact with the app directly on Hugging Face Spaces:  
[Heart Attack Prediction App](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Waris01/Heart-Attack-Prediction-App)

## Features

- **Age**: User can input their age (1â€“100).
- **Gender**: Select gender (Male/Female).
- **Medical Data**: Input values for blood pressure, glucose levels, heart rate, troponin, and more.
- **Prediction**: Predicts whether the user is likely to have a heart disease based on the entered data.

## How to Use

1. **Open the app**: Click on the demo link above to open the Heart Disease Prediction app.
2. **Enter the details**:
    - Provide values for parameters like age, gender, impulse, blood pressure, glucose, etc.
3. **Click "Submit"**: Once all data is entered, click the "Submit" button to receive the prediction result.
4. **View the result**: The app will show whether the user is likely to have heart disease or not based on the input data.

## Model Details

This application uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** model trained to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on a dataset containing features like:
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Glucose Levels**
- **Heart Rate**
- **Troponin Levels**

The model has been serialized using **pickle** and is loaded in the app to make predictions.
